    "# Linear Programming\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "A **Linear Programming problem** may be defined as the problem of *maximizing or minimizing a linear function subject to linear constraints.* The constraints may be equalities or inequalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance: \n",
    "\n",
    "*Find the numbers $x_{1}$ and $x_{x2}$ that maximize the sum $x_{1}$+$x_{2}$ subject to the constraints;*\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case we have 2 unknowns $x_{1}$ & $x_{2}$ as well as 5 constraints. \n",
    "The first two constraints, $x_{1} \\geq 0$ & $x_{2} \\geq 0$, are known as the **non-negativity constraints.**\n",
    "The other coinstraints are then called the **main constraints**.\n",
    "The function to be maximised or minimized is called the **objective function**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 classes of problems here called the **Standard Maximum Problem** and the **Standard Minimum Problem** that play a special role. In these problems, all variables are constrained to be nonnegative, and all main constraints are inequalities. \n",

    "### Terminology\n",
    "- A vector, $x$ for the maximum problem or $y$ for the minimum problem is said to be **feasible** if it satisfies the corresponding constraints. \n",
    "- The set of feasible vectors is known as the **constraint set**\n",
    "- A linear programming problem is said to be **feasible** if the constraint set is not empty; Otherwise it is said to be **infeasible**\n",
    "- A feasible maximum & its respective minimum problem is said to be **unbounded** if the objective function can assume arbitrarily large positive/negative values (respectively) at feasible vectors. Otherwise it is said to be **bounded**. This gives 3 possibilities for a linear programming problem, ie\n",
    "    - Bounded Feasible\n",
    "    - Unbounded Feasible\n",
    "    - Infeasible\n",
    "- The **value** of a bounded feasible maximum/minimum problem is the maximum/minimum value of the objective function as the variables range over the constraint set. \n",
    "- A feasible vector at which the objective function achieves the value is called **Optimal**\n",
    "\n",
    "### All linear programming Problems can be converted to Standard Form:\n",
    "They can be converted into the form of a standard maximum problem by the following techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimum can be converted to a maximum problem by multiplying the objective function by $-1$. Similarly, the constraints of the form  $ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}x_{j} \\geq b_{i} $ can be changed in to the form $ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} -a_{ij}x_{j} \\leq b_{i} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Other problems arise: \n",
    "1. *Some constraints may be equalities*: an equality constraint $ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}x_{j} = b_{i} $ may be removed by solving this constraint for some $x_{j}$ for which $ a_{ij} \\neq 0 $ and substituting this solution into the other constraintts and into the objective function wherever $x_{j}$ appears. This removes one constraint and one variable from the problem. \n",
    "2. *Some variables may not be restricted to non-negative*: An unrestricted variable $x_{j}$ may be replaced by the difference of two nonnegative variables, $x_{j} = u_{j}-v_{j} $, where $u_{j} \\geq 0$ and $v_{j} \\geq 0$. This adds one variable and two nonnegativity constraints to the problem. "
